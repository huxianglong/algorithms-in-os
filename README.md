This project implements four most important algorithms/comcepts in the operating
system, linker, scheduler(CPU), memory management unit and I/O scheduler.

For the scheduler in lab02, first(last) come first serve, round robin, shortest 
remaining time next and priority scheduling algorithms are implemented.

For the memory management in lab03, first in first out, second chance, random, 
not recently used, clock and aging are implemented.

For the I/O scheduler of disk in lab04, first in first out, shortedt seek time 
first and elevator algorithms like look, clook and flook are implemented.

These four labs follow the OOP style, written in C++. The four labs add upp to 
about 2, 000 lines of code.
